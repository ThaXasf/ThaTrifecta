The gym is divided into crossfit, weight room, kickboxing and jiu jitsu, we provide showers and locker rooms. In addition we have calm areas where visitors can use our quiet meditation rooms. Throughout the facilities there are positive quotes hidden and exposed to give an extra dose of positive vibes for visitors.
